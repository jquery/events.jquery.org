						CSS3 animations and transitions offer increased browser performance for animations on desktop and mobile. However, they also introduce a completely different approach to animations than jQuery's animate functions. Even if you choose to use CSS3, are fallbacks using jQuery animation even worth it? Are there ever situations where jQuery’s animate function would be preferred over CSS3 animation?
					</p>
					<p>
						In this session you will learn when to use jQuery, CSS3 or both together; how to control animations and transitions from jQuery and how to account for animation fallbacks in your code. This session will also cover how the jQuery animation queue behaves and present strategies for using that queue with CSS3 and other custom code in your application.

					<h3>Helping or hurting?</h3>

						We are in a time of change. The web as we knew it is not only changing in terms of technologies and demands - but user preferences are changing, too. More and more people are experiencing the web first and foremost on mobile devices and tablets which brings new challenges to us as developers. For years now libraries have made it easier for developers to build engaging and beautiful products by abstracting away issues like DOM access and event handling into a predictable and simple syntax. This is great and it gave the web a much bigger boost than anything else. Now is the time for libraries to help with the newer challenge of a changing environment.
						"The web always wins" is not a given - we have to keep evolving and innovating with it. Libraries are a great solution to make it easy for developers to build products without much hassle but the libraries we use nowadays more and more solve problems of the past rather than simplifying the near future. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Mozilla will show how we can lead the next generation of developers to build for the web instead of adding cruft to it. The mobile revolution is upon us and we have the means and the knowledge to lead it.

							For building the TYPO3 Phoenix User Interface, we've used a wide variety of frameworks and technologies. Besides jQuery and EmberJS at its core, we also use jQuery UI and a number of frameworks for in-page content editing such as VIE, CreateJS and Aloha. For managing this number of external dependencies, we soon started to embrace RequireJS as dependency management solution.            However, during implementation, it turns out that some problems such as multiple jQuery versions, external non-AMD code, importing complete requireJS applications or debugging loading-order issues are non-trivial to solve. In this talk, you will get an overview about these problems, together with the solutions we found for them, as these are applicable for many big JavaScript projects.

This talk is an outside point of view on jQuery's internals. After explaining some of the genesis of jQuery inside Drupal, we'll focus on what the Drupal community is using, underusing or misusing from jQuery. Then we'll talk about the challenges of Drupal's next version — scheduled to ship this year — and how jQuery fits in the picture, giving some feedback in the process.

It allows users to edit content directly on the web pages where it is presented. Built as a set of jQuery UI widgets, it integrates easily with any web framework, allowing developers to decouple their content editing tools from the rest of the system.

							For years you have been using jQuery on the client-side. And now there is Node.js on the server-side. And this basically means that all the things you have loved about jQuery are dead and gone, right? Wrong! Although there is no DOM on the server (at least not by default) there are lots of tasks you can accomplish using jQuery *and* Node.js! In this talk Golo Roden presents three server-side scenarios where jQuery is the perfect companion for Node.js! So if do you love jQuery and you need to do server-side programming with Node.js, join :-)!

							<p>The more information-rich our societies become, the more demand there is for representing information visually, and the HTML5 platform is one of the best ways to create visualizations and communicate a message. Either for making sense of quantitative data, displaying qualitative information or simply creating the next Mona Lisa, technologies like CSS3, SVG, Canvas, WebGL, etc, provide a very powerful toolbox for developers, designers and artists.</p>

							<p>In this presentation we’re going to start of by examining all the enabling HTML5 technologies that were mentioned, their features and how they are used in practice to deliver captivating user experiences. Then we’re going to move one level up and talk about the frameworks that make these powerful but sometimes overly complex technologies, more accessible to programmers. We’re going to see frameworks like Raphaël, Processing.js, D3.js, Fabric.js, etc, their features and their applicability. Finally, time permitting, we’re going to go over online examples that best demonstrate the power of the web platform for visualizations and analyze how they were created.</p>

This session will cover how jQuery Mobile naturally helps designers and developers incorporate good UI design principles in their mobile applications. Each good UI design rule will be illustrated with jQuery Mobile examples and demos to show how the framework helps incorporate these rules into mobile web applications. Such illustrations will cover but won't be restricted to the automatic back button in the header, the page loading widget, shortcuts with the searchable lists and panels, affordance with icons, and consistency of style through themes and swatches.

								CSS3 animations and transitions offer increased browser performance for animations on desktop and mobile. However, they also introduce a completely different approach to animations than jQuery's animate functions. Even if you choose to use CSS3, are fallbacks using jQuery animation even worth it? Are there ever situations where jQuery’s animate function would be preferred over CSS3 animation?
							</p>
							<p>
								In this session you will learn when to use jQuery, CSS3 or both together; how to control animations and transitions from jQuery and how to account for animation fallbacks in your code. This session will also cover how the jQuery animation queue behaves and present strategies for using that queue with CSS3 and other custom code in your application.

								For building the TYPO3 Phoenix User Interface, we've used a wide variety of frameworks and technologies. Besides jQuery and EmberJS at its core, we also use jQuery UI and a number of frameworks for in-page content editing such as VIE, CreateJS and Aloha. For managing this number of external dependencies, we soon started to embrace RequireJS as dependency management solution.            However, during implementation, it turns out that some problems such as multiple jQuery versions, external non-AMD code, importing complete requireJS applications or debugging loading-order issues are non-trivial to solve. In this talk, you will get an overview about these problems, together with the solutions we found for them, as these are applicable for many big JavaScript projects.

							We are in a time of change. The web as we knew it is not only changing in terms of technologies and demands - but user preferences are changing, too. More and more people are experiencing the web first and foremost on mobile devices and tablets which brings new challenges to us as developers. For years now libraries have made it easier for developers to build engaging and beautiful products by abstracting away issues like DOM access and event handling into a predictable and simple syntax. This is great and it gave the web a much bigger boost than anything else. Now is the time for libraries to help with the newer challenge of a changing environment.
							"The web always wins" is not a given - we have to keep evolving and innovating with it. Libraries are a great solution to make it easy for developers to build products without much hassle but the libraries we use nowadays more and more solve problems of the past rather than simplifying the near future. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Mozilla will show how we can lead the next generation of developers to build for the web instead of adding cruft to it. The mobile revolution is upon us and we have the means and the knowledge to lead it.

								jQuery has made it possible for developers to move more and more complex application logic down from the server to the client. This is a huge opportunity for JavaScript developers, and at the same time presents a tempting target for folks with malicious intent. It's more critical than ever to ensure that we're doing the right things with regard to security, and happily, modern browsers are here to help. Here, we'll talk about some of the new ways in which you can mitigate the effects of cross-site scripting and other attacks.

								With Drupal powering more than 2% of existing websites (including big websites!) the Drupal community has had a lot of exposure to the goodness of jQuery and also to it's bugs and shortcomings. This talk is an outside point of view on jQuery's internals. After explaining some of the genesis of jQuery inside Drupal, we'll focus on what the Drupal community is using, underusing or misusing from jQuery. Then we'll talk about the challenges of Drupal's next version — scheduled to ship this year — and how jQuery fits in the picture, giving some feedback in the process.

							<p>The more information-rich our societies become, the more demand there is for representing information visually, and the HTML5 platform is one of the best ways to create visualizations and communicate a message. Either for making sense of quantitative data, displaying qualitative information or simply creating the next Mona Lisa, technologies like CSS3, SVG, Canvas, WebGL, etc, provide a very powerful toolbox for developers, designers and artists.</p>

							<p>In this presentation we’re going to start of by examining all the enabling HTML5 technologies that were mentioned, their features and how they are used in practice to deliver captivating user experiences. Then we’re going to move one level up and talk about the frameworks that make these powerful but sometimes overly complex technologies, more accessible to programmers. We’re going to see frameworks like Raphaël, Processing.js, D3.js, Fabric.js, etc, their features and their applicability. Finally, time permitting, we’re going to go over online examples that best demonstrate the power of the web platform for visualizations and analyze how they were created.</p>

								When developing Mobile Web applications, it is essential to ensure that the user will be able to carry out the tasks they require effectively, and that the experience of doing so is a good and enjoyable one. This session will cover how jQuery Mobile naturally helps designers and developers incorporate good UI design principles in their mobile applications. Each good UI design rule will be illustrated with jQuery Mobile examples and demos to show how the framework helps incorporate these rules into mobile web applications. Such illustrations will cover but won't be restricted to the automatic back button in the header, the page loading widget, shortcuts with the searchable lists and panels, affordance with icons, and consistency of style through themes and swatches.

								Create.js is an inline editing toolkit for JavaScript, designed to be used by content management systems and other web applications. It allows users to edit content directly on the web pages where it is presented. Built as a set of jQuery UI widgets, it integrates easily with any web framework, allowing developers to decouple their content editing tools from the rest of the system. This session will introduce the ideas of Decoupled Content Management, and show how jQuery UI and Create.js can be used as the front-end editing tool in any web application.
